## SEO

- **H1:** QR code API pricing. No surprises.

## Section 1: Hero Pricing
### Intention
Set the tone immediately: this is the anti-bait-and-switch pricing page. Developers who've been burned by QR SaaS pricing traps should feel relief within 3 seconds. The H1 names the thing they fear ("surprises") and negates it.
### Content
**Title (H1):** QR code API pricing. No surprises.

**Subtitle:** Free to start. Pay as you grow. Your QR codes never expire silently.

**Body:** Most QR code services lure you in with a "free" plan, then deactivate your codes after 14 days and demand $25-50/month to keep them alive. We built QR for Agent to be the opposite. The free tier is real. The API is included. And your QR codes keep working.

**CTA secondary:** View on GitHub
### Notes visuelles
Clean, full-width hero with dark background. No pricing cards visible yet -- just the H1, subtitle, body text, and two buttons (primary filled, secondary outlined). The visual tone should match the homepage hero: confident, minimal, text-forward. No illustrations or stock imagery.

## Section 2: Plans
### Intention
Present the two plans side by side. The Free plan must feel generous and complete -- not like a crippled trial. The Pro plan signals that growth is supported without locking features behind it today. The "Coming soon" label keeps expectations honest.
### Content
**Title (H2):** Two plans. One principle: you see exactly what you pay for.

| | **Free** | **Pro** |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $0 / forever | Usage-based (coming soon) |
| Dynamic QR codes | Included | Included |
| Full REST API access | Included | Included |
| MCP server access | Included | Included |
| Scan analytics | Included | Included |
| Multi-tenant isolation | Included | Included |
| Open source (MIT) | Included | Included |
| Higher rate limits | Generous free tier | Extended limits |
| Priority support | Community (GitHub) | Dedicated support |
| Custom domain | -- | Included |
| SLA | -- | Included |
| | **No credit card required.** | **Pay only for what you use.** |
| | [Get Your API Key] | [Join the Waitlist] |

**Note below table:** The Pro plan is currently in development. Pricing will be usage-based -- you pay for what you consume, not for an arbitrary tier. Join the waitlist to get early access and input on pricing.
### Notes visuelles
Two-column card layout. Free column should have a subtle highlight or border to show it's the recommended starting point. Pro column uses a "Coming Soon" badge. The table should be clean and scannable -- no icons, no color-coded rows. On mobile, stack the two cards vertically.

## Section 3: What's Included in Free
### Intention
Hammer the point: the free tier is not a demo. Developers coming from competitors where "free" means "7-day trial that silently expires" need to see exactly what they get. This section lists everything and calls out that API access is included -- the thing competitors charge $49+/month for.
### Content
**Title (H2):** What $0 gets you

**Subtitle:** Everything you need to give your AI agent -- or your app -- full QR code capabilities. No trial. No expiry. No credit card.

**Dynamic QR codes**
Create QR codes that you can update after printing. Change the destination URL anytime -- the image stays the same. Your agent handles it with a single prompt.

**Full REST API**
Every endpoint. No paywall. No "upgrade to unlock API access." Other services charge $49/month just to make an API call. Here, the API is the product -- and it's free to start.

**MCP server access**
`npx qr-for-agent` -- your AI agent creates, updates, and tracks QR codes in natural language. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client.

**Scan analytics**
Track every scan: count, timestamp, referrer. Your agent can pull analytics data and adjust campaigns without opening a dashboard.

**Multi-tenant isolation**
One API key per client. Build agents that serve multiple customers with complete data isolation. Agencies and consultants: this is built for your workflow.

**Open source**
MIT-licensed. Read the code on GitHub. Self-host on your own infrastructure if you prefer. No vendor lock-in -- if we disappear, your QR codes keep working.

**CTA:** Get Your API Key
### Notes visuelles
Six feature blocks in a 2x3 grid (or 3x2 on wide screens). Each block has a bold title and 2-3 lines of text. No icons -- keep it text-forward like the homepage features section. Consider a subtle accent color for the "Full REST API" block to draw attention to the key differentiator (free API access).

---

## Section 4: Comparison with Alternatives
### Intention
Make the cost difference undeniable without naming competitors aggressively. Use real pricing data from competitor analysis. The angle is not "they're bad" -- it's "here's what the market charges, and here's what we include for free." Let the numbers speak.
### Content
**Title (H2):** What others charge $49/month for, we include for free.

**Subtitle:** "Most QR code APIs are either overpriced ($50+/month for basic generation), overcomplicated, or require using their hosted dashboard." Here's how the market compares.

| Feature | QR for Agent (Free) | Typical QR SaaS |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| API access | Included at $0 | $29-49/month minimum |
| MCP integration | Native -- 6 dedicated tools | None (or via Zapier) |
| Dynamic QR codes | Included | Often locked behind paid plans |
| Scan analytics | Included | Varies by tier |
| Dashboard required | No. API-first. | Yes -- API is an add-on |
| QR codes after trial | Never deactivated | Deactivated without warning |
| Source code | Open source on GitHub | Closed source |
| Pricing model | Free to start, usage-based Pro | Monthly subscription with arbitrary limits |

**Body below table:** For context: Uniqode charges $49/month for API access. Bitly charges $29/month for 10 QR codes. QR Tiger starts at $37/month for their API plan. QR for Agent gives you the full API, MCP access, and dynamic QR codes at $0.

**CTA:** View on GitHub
### Notes visuelles
Full-width comparison table. QR for Agent column highlighted with a subtle brand color background. "Typical QR SaaS" column in neutral gray. On mobile, consider a stacked card format. The pricing figures below the table should be rendered as a compact, easy-to-scan list -- not buried in paragraph text.

## Section 5: FAQ Pricing
### Intention
Address the objections that come from an audience burned by QR SaaS bait-and-switch practices. Every question maps to a real fear from the market research. Answers are short, direct, and trust-building.
### Content
**Title (H2):** Frequently asked questions

**Q: Is the free tier really free?**
Yes. No trial period. No expiry date. No "free for 14 days then we deactivate your codes." The free tier includes dynamic QR codes, full API access, MCP server access, scan analytics, and multi-tenant isolation. You don't need to enter a credit card.

**Q: Will my QR codes stop working?**
No. Your QR codes are never silently deactivated. We've read the same reviews you have -- "a user generated a 'free' QR code for wedding invitations, but received an email two weeks later saying their free trial expired after they had already printed and mailed the invitations." That does not happen here. If anything changes with your account, you'll get clear notice and time to act.

**Q: Do I need a credit card to start?**
No. Sign up, get your API key, and start creating QR codes. No payment information required.

**Q: What happens when I hit the free tier limit?**
You'll get a clear notification before you reach the limit, and another when you hit it. Your existing QR codes keep working -- they are never deactivated. You'll have a straightforward upgrade path to the Pro plan when it launches.

**Q: Can I self-host instead of using the cloud service?**
Yes. QR for Agent is MIT-licensed and fully open source. Clone the repo, deploy with Docker or Railway, and run it on your own infrastructure. Full self-hosting documentation is available in the [docs](/docs).

**Q: What will the Pro plan cost?**
The Pro plan will be usage-based -- you pay for what you consume, not for an arbitrary monthly tier. Pricing details are being finalized. Join the waitlist to get early access and have a say in the pricing structure.
### Notes visuelles
Accordion-style FAQ. Each question is a clickable row that expands to show the answer. Keep the typography clean -- bold for questions, regular weight for answers. The verbatim quote in the second answer should be styled as a subtle blockquote (lighter color, left border) to make it stand out as a real user experience.

---

## Section 6: CTA Final
### Intention
Close the page with conviction. Restate the core pricing promise. One clear action. Mirror the homepage CTA final for visual and tonal consistency.
### Content
**Title (H2):** Start free. No credit card. No surprises.

**Body:** Dynamic QR codes. Full API. MCP access. Scan analytics. Open source. $0.

**CTA primary:** Get Your API Key
**CTA secondary:** View on GitHub
### Notes visuelles
Full-width section with dark or brand-colored background. Large centered text. Two buttons side by side (primary filled, secondary outlined). This section should mirror the homepage CTA final as a visual bookend. Minimal -- no additional text or elements beyond the title, body line, and buttons.

---

## Internal Links Checklist
- [x] / (home) -- referenced implicitly through consistent navigation; explicit link possible in FAQ or comparison
- [x] /docs -- linked in FAQ (self-hosting answer) and comparison section CTA
- [x] /pricing -- this is the page itself; linked from homepage comparison section

## Verbatims Used
1. "Most QR code APIs are either overpriced ($50+/month for basic generation), overcomplicated, or require using their hosted dashboard." -- Hacker News (Section 4: Comparison subtitle)
2. "A user generated a 'free' QR code for wedding invitations, but received an email two weeks later saying their free trial expired after they had already printed and mailed the invitations." -- Trustpilot (Section 5: FAQ, "Will my QR codes stop working?")
3. The bait-and-switch pattern referenced in Section 1 hero body draws from multiple Trustpilot/Capterra verbatims: "classic bait-and-switch tactic", "deactivated it and demanded $25 a month", "scam, deliberately defaults you to their 7 day trial"

## Competitor Pricing Referenced (verified from competitor-analysis.md)
- Uniqode: $49/month for API access (Pro plan)
- Bitly: $29/month for Growth plan (10 QR codes/month)
- QR Tiger: $37/month for Premium plan (API access)
- QR.io: $35/month (no permanent free tier)
