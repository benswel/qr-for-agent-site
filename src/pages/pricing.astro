    question: "Is the free tier really free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. No trial period. No expiry date. No \"free for 14 days then we deactivate your codes.\" The free tier includes 10 dynamic QR codes, 1,000 scans/month, custom styled QR codes, full API access, MCP server (9 tools), scan analytics, 1 webhook endpoint, and multi-tenant isolation. You don't need to enter a credit card.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my QR codes stop working?",
    answer:
      'No. Your QR codes are never silently deactivated. We\'ve read the same reviews you have -- "a user generated a \'free\' QR code for wedding invitations, but received an email two weeks later saying their free trial expired after they had already printed and mailed the invitations." That does not happen here. If anything changes with your account, you\'ll get clear notice and time to act.',
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a credit card to start?",
    answer:
      "No. Sign up, get your API key, and start creating QR codes. No payment information required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I hit the free tier limit?",
    answer:
      "The free tier includes 10 QR codes and 1,000 scans/month. You'll get a clear notification before you reach the limit, and another when you hit it. Your existing QR codes keep working -- they are never deactivated. Upgrade to Pro ($19/month) for unlimited QR codes and scans.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I self-host instead of using the cloud service?",
    answer:
      'Yes. QR for Agent is MIT-licensed and fully open source. Clone the repo, deploy with Docker or Railway, and run it on your own infrastructure. Full self-hosting documentation is available in the <a href="/docs" class="underline hover:text-foreground">docs</a>.',
  },
  {
    question: "What will the Pro plan cost?",
    answer:
      "The Pro plan will be $19/month. You get unlimited QR codes, unlimited scans, unlimited webhooks, custom domain for branded short URLs, 99.9% uptime SLA, and priority support. Join the waitlist to get early access when it launches.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are custom QR codes and webhooks included in the free tier?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Custom styled QR codes (colors, dot shapes, corner styles, logo embedding) are included at every tier. The free tier includes 1 webhook endpoint for real-time scan notifications. Pro gives you unlimited webhooks.",

      Most QR code services lure you in with a "free" plan, then deactivate your codes after 14 days and demand $25-50/month to keep them alive. We built QR for Agent to be the opposite. The free tier is real. The API is included. And your QR codes keep working.
